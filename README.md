This python bot inputs letters and finds out if the letter was grey yellow or green and removes all the words that dont fit those guidelines and deletes them from the list

On startup you must go through and click on each of the boxes from left to right in the top row and then do the same for the first column but from top to bottom. This is done to map out each of the boxes on a grid to recive the color values of each letter. If having any trouble on this section watch the video to see an example
